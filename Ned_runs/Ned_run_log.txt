TC Ned experiment run log

Trying to recreate TC Ned, March/April 1989

These runs were done prior to using the hybrid WRF model
None of these runs produced a viable TC
  - they all degraded within a couple of days (if they lasted that long)
TCs were not bogussed - trying to see if they would evolve naturally
  - they didn't...

Note that these were run before discovering the need to run
calc_ecmwf_p.exe with ERA-interim data
  - One possible cause for all the seg faults experienced prior
    to getting the run going

Ned3
- Run with only one domain (was still debugging)
- Run from 1989-03-24-00 to 1989-04-02-00

Ned4
- Same run as Ned3 with with two domains
  - domain two started on 1989-03-25-00

Ned5
- Same run as Ned3 but with three domains
  - domain three started on 1989-03-26-00

Ned6
- Same as Ned5 but domains two and three both start on
  1989-03-26-00


Output files from all of these runs were deleted to save space. 
Namelists available for each real.exe run. WPS preprocessing the
same as was done for inputs to the hybrid runs. 

See HPRM files D2016-63083 and D2016-138348 for details of 
ERA-interim inputs used for this (and the hybrid) runs.
